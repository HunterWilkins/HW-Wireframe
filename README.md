# HW-Wireframe

Hard-Coding:

style.css{

    line 33 (aside):
        width:445px;

        ~ Without a div, this isn't going to work.
        My idea is to have the combination of "section" and "aside" equal 100% of the body's width.

        For example, I once had both section and aside equal 50% of the body each. Even when I did it like this, "aside" was located *beneath* "section." It acted like it was too large to be contained on the same line as "section." That's because of the margins/padding. However, the assignment requires margins and padding. So, I ended up having to find the exact remaining width "aside" would have to take up and subtract the margin's value. Not a permanent fix. 

    line 35 (aside): 
        height:273px;
    
        ~ I could not for the life of me figure out how to get the "aside" section to match the height of the "section/article" section. So, I input the exact pixel height. Not a permanent fix.
